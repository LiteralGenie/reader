# The series folder should contain chapter folders 
# which in turn should contain page images (.png, .jpg)
# and the ocr_data.json file generated by @todo
# 
# Chapters and pages should be named alphabetically to match the reading order
# 
# For example:
# my_series_folder
#     some_series
#          chap_01
#              ocr_data.json
#              01.png
#              02.png
#          chap_02
#              ocr_data.json
#              01.png
#              02.png
#     some_other_series
#          ...
